Note: There's an exploit in which, while you can't throw your swords, you can place them in a chest. So you can place them there, kill yourself and when you respawn, you'll have a second copy.
As far as I know, there's nothing I can do to fix that. If you know any way to do it, please report it. Use this information as your own discretion.
